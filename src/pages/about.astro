					👋 Hi, I’m Figo Perdana Putra, a passionate developer with a focus on Software Engineering, Network Engineering, and DevOps.
					<br /><br />
					My interest in technology sparked during my university years while studying Computer Science. Since then, I've embraced the fast-paced nature of web and software development, always eager to learn new skills and tools as the industry evolves 🔥.
				  </p>
				  <br />
				  <p>
					Fast-forward to today, I’ve had the privilege of working in multiple roles across different industries. I started my career as a <a href="https://lumintu-logic.com/">Fullstack Developer at PT. Lumintu Logic</a>, followed by a role as a <a href="https://nusabot.id/">Backend Developer at PT. Nusabot Inovasi Teknologi</a>, where I improved user engagement and optimized backend systems.
					I later transitioned to <a href="https://mastersystem.co.id">Network Engineer at PT. Mastersystem Infotama</a>, where I enhanced network efficiency for clients such as PT. Bank Central Asia Tbk, while also boosting system reliability.
				  </p>
				  <br />
				  <p>
					Alongside my role as a Network Engineer, I serve as a mentor and advisor at <a href="https://dicoding.com">PT. Presentologics (Dicoding)</a>, guiding students in Fullstack Web Development and DevOps practices such as Docker and Kubernetes. I’m continually exploring new technologies and consulting on various projects, while working towards building scalable web and network solutions.
				  </p>
				  <br />
				  <p>
					My expertise lies in creating efficient software solutions, optimizing networks for high reliability, and leveraging DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform to ensure seamless operations across all systems I manage.
